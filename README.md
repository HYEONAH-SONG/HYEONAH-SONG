### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am **HyeonAh Song** who is interested in Cloud Architect.

I like to have a variety of experiences, plan strategies for solving many problems, and drive innovation to create business opportunities.

I am still missing, but I will make my dreams come true by steadily working hard and building my own career like the quote 'Effort is the best way to realize your dreams'.
