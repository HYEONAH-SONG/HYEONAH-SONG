#### Hi there,  I am **Hyeon Ah ** who is interested in *Cloud Architect*! :raising_hand:

I like to have a variety of experiences to communicate with different people, plan strategies for solving many problems, and drive innovation to create business opportunities.

I will make my dreams come true by steadily working hard and building my own career like the quote **'Effort is the best way to realize your dreams'.** 

#### :dizzy: Experience​
